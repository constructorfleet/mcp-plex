        "content": "Why did the original \"Alien\" and follow up \"Aliens\", films work? The back story was far fetched certainly but it had a grittiness, a sense of realism, that denied disbelief. The characters were the sort of rough hewen, mature, resourceful people, you'd expect to find on a space freighter or in the military. It made sense.\r\n\r\nNow imagine mostly soft faced types, who feel like they belong teaching tutorials on a university campus or running a yoga class, in the same environment. Because that's what you get with \"Aliens Earth\". You could say its middle class leftist Californians, facing off against horrific, alien monsters. In the context of a dark comedy, it could have had potential.\r\n\r\nAs you might expect the sense of plausibility, raw realism and creeping dread, isn't there. The characterisations and acting, are none too inspiring either. An unoriginal story, that borrows heavily from the original films and even manages to do a bad \"Blade Runner\" knock off,  rounds out the sense of pervading blandness.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the whole premise feels unconvincing. I really don't know how they managed to make something so amateurish out of high quality, iconic material but well, they did. Not recommended.",
